## Information about the course:
Course name Advanced Programming.

Instructor: Prof. Dr. Tobias Schaffer.

This is a course provided in the A.I. for Smart Sensors and Actuators to familiarize students to coding, coding standards, best practices and working with Git.

The excercises are taken from: [Google's Python course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).

Each exercises are done using seperate functions and tested with multiple testing cases.

## Instructions for code execution:
The python code is executed directly in the editor. Simply open in an editor of choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code) and run the files, and the result will be printed out via the Terminal.

**Python version: Python 3.11.9**

List of libraries used:
- sys

- re

**Instrution to execute wordcount.py**
- cd to relative path.
- Run the commands in the terminal: `.\google-python-exercises\basic\wordcount.py` with arguments `--count` for count all the words or `--topcount` for count only the top 20 words, and file name such as `alice.txt` and `small.txt`.
E.g. `.\google-python-exercises\basic\wordcount.py --topcount alice.txt`

**Instrution to execute mimic.py**
- cd to relative path.
- Run the commands in the terminal: `.\google-python-exercises\basic\mimic.py` and file name such as `alice.txt` and `small.txt`.
E.g. `.\google-python-exercises\basic\mimic.py small.txt`

**Instrution to execute babynames.py**
- cd to relative path.
- Run the commands in the terminal: `.\google-python-exercises\basic\babynames.py` with the `--summaryfile` arguement and file name such as `baby2008.html` or `baby1998.html`.
E.g. `.\google-python-exercises\babynames\babynames.py --summaryfile baby2006.html`
